    <h1>Logan Hardy</h1>

    <p>With IS 403: Enterprise Application Development, I hope to gain a greater understanding on web applications, both front and back end.  
       I also haven't had any previous experience with Visual Studio, so I'm excited to become more familiar with it before I enter the workforce. 
       I hope that we will have an opportunity to design websites to be mobile friendly as well, and maybe design an actual application that could be downloaded from an app store</p>
